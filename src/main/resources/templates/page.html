The majority of his success and fame has come from impressive features on other artists' work, and strong word of mouth by his more dedicated listeners. Many people were unaware for months that he was the one who lent his angelic vocals to Goldlink’s 2016 hit “Crew”. That chorus sounds just as good today as it did the first time I heard it, and I’m not alone in that sentiment.</p>

But no matter what corner of the internet you’re immersed in, Yeat has been inescapable this summer. Behind a mixtape called 4L, singles like “Sorry Bout That” and “Mad Bout That,” and a viral snippet turned breakout single “Gët Busy”, which got everyone from Lil Yachty to Drake to recite the line “This song was already turnt, but here’s a bell”.</p>

Thug is best known for his auto-tuned warbling, charismatic flow, and generally experimental approach to rapping, dubbing Lil Wayne his biggest idol and influence. At the 2019 Grammy Awards Young Thug won his first Grammys for his work on Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” which won both Record & Song Of The Year. </p>

            <p class="lead">Vincent Jamal "Vince" Staples is an American rapper from Long Beach, California. Staples began his career as a close affiliate of Odd Future, particularly Mike G and Earl Sweatshirt. He rose to prominence with appearances on albums by Odd Future members and his collaborative mixtape Stolen Youth with Mac Miller. Vince Staples thrives on contrasts. His lyrics are filled with first-person accounts of a grim adolescence and isolated moments of anguish that feel both lived-in and distant all at once. </p>
